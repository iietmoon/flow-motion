# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We value clear and descriptive commit messages that provide context and aid in understanding the changes made to the codebase. When making contributions to this project, please follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:

1. **Use Standardized Prefixes**: Prefix your commit messages with one of the following types to indicate the nature of the changes:
    - `feat`: For adding new features or functionalities.
    - `fix`: For addressing issues or bugs.
    - `chore`: For tasks or activities that are not directly related to features or bug fixes.
    - `docs`: For changes or updates to documentation.
    - `style`: For changes that improve code readability or maintainability without affecting functionality.
    - `refactor`: For code changes that improve the codebase's structure, organization, or performance.
    - `test`: For changes or additions to tests.
    - `build`: For changes to the build system or configuration.
    - `ci`: For changes or updates to the continuous integration (CI) configuration or scripts.
    - `perf`: For performance improvements or optimizations.

2. **Be Descriptive**: Provide a concise and descriptive summary of the changes made in the commit message. Use present tense and imperative mood, e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".

3. **Reference Issues**: If your commit addresses a specific issue or task, include a reference to the corresponding issue number in the commit message. For example, "Fix issue #123" or "Implement feature #456".

Following these guidelines helps maintain a clean and informative commit history, making it easier for contributors to understand the changes made over time and facilitating collaboration within the project community.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
